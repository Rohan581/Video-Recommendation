Art Of Collage Aka Art Of Collaers (1958),www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKoRWBSXRec,Art&Music,"London.



Story about a modern art form - collage.  Various shots of a piece of collage art then footage of one of the foremost exponents of this art form E.L.T. Mesens at work.  Mesens lights a piece of newspaper with  cigarette.  He then glues the piece of paper with burnt edges onto a piece of coloured card.  Messens uses bus tickets, burnt spills of paper and cigarette cartons as well as many other things.  Messens adds various bits and pieces to his design including some salt and pepper!



The name of Mesens is synonymous with European Dada and surrealism the narrator informs us.  



A display of collage work at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) is featured.  Art lovers look at the works which include pieces by John McHale and Gwyther Irwin.



Narrator seems slightly dismissive about this style of art - poking fun a little bit.



Note: spellings vary in paperwork - could be E.L.T. Messens.

Getting started with collage art -- Part 1,www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL62fy4YlkQ,Art&Music,"This 2 part video on getting started is intended for anyone who is new to doing collage art, or anyone who has already had experience with collaging but would like to find a new interest or get some new ideas about collecting scraps and making collage art. The goal of doing collage art is to enjoy using up scraps you've collected, and to gain confidence in creating a collage composition. 

In part 1 I talk about the materials you use, such as the type of collages you can make, and then give you ideas of where you can collect scraps.

Abstract Collage on Canvas  Easy Mixed Media Art Project,www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIP8eXu9WOw,Art&Music,"This is an easy mixed media collage on canvas created with hand painted paper. I used matte medium to adhere the painted paper to the canvas and I outlined each strip of paper with a black oil-based paint marker. This art project is presented as a pictorial (tutorial). Doing this project has given me so many other ideas. I may ‘paint’ a picture using this collage method one day. I can already imagine creating a beautiful sunset with just painted paper.
